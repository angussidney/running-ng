# Running
This is a rewrite of `running` in Python. Say goodbye to Perl.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/caizixian/running-ng.git
pip install -e .
```

## Status
With more features implemented, you should be able to progressively replace the old running with this implementation.

- `running fillin`: should have the same behaviour as `fillin`
