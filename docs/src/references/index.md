# Configuration File Syntax
The configuration file is in YAML format.
You can find a good YAML tutorial [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html).
Below is the documentation for all the top-level keys that are common to all commands.

## `benchmarks`

## `configs`

## `includes`

## `modifiers`

## `overrides`

## `runtimes`

## `suites`
