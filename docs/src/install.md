# Installation
For now, the best way to install `running-ng` is via source.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anupli/running-ng
cd running-ng
pip install -e . --user
# Add Python user install directory to your PATH
```

The `-e` option is used to allow quick update of `running-ng` by running `git pull`.
Once the codebase is more stabilized, other installation options, such as installing from PyPI, could be preferable.
